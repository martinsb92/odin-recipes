    <p>Pizza dough is a yeasted dough that requires active dry yeast. Make sure the check the 
    expiration date on the yeast package! Yeast that is too old may be dead and won't work.
    </p>
    <p>Also, if the yeast does not begin to foam or bloom within 10 minutes of being added to
    the water in Step 1 of Making the Pizza Dough, it is probably dead. You'll need to start 
    over with new, active yeast.
